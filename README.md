# College_C_Codes


This repository list the codes run by me on the basis of the knowledge from college teacher and internet. Most of the ideas of codes are from college but some are mine too.
Am Creating this here ti keep a track record of myself, and also to be able to access the files from anywhere I want it to.


The main aim while creating every program is to get the most creattive and best output with maximum information, and automation. 



Also the things which were thought to be added but don't know the way are listed at the last of the program in a multiline comment.
